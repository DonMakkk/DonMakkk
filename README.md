# 👋 Hi, I'm Don Makkk

Welcome to my GitHub profile!  
I'm a passionate developer who enjoys building projects using **JavaScript** with a strong focus on **backend development** using **Express.js**.  
I love designing efficient server-side logic, working with databases, and bringing ideas to life through clean and scalable code.
